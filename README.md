### FAQ Common Questions

**What makes infrared grills different from standard gas or charcoal grills?**
Infrared grills use radiant heat that cooks food directly without heating the air around it, reaching much higher temperatures faster while sealing in moisture better than conventional methods.

**Are portable high-temperature grills safe for apartment balconies or patios?**
Check your building's regulations first, as many prohibit open-flame cooking. Electric infrared models often comply where gas is restricted, but always verify local rules before purchasing.

**How quickly can these grills get ready to cook compared to traditional grills?**
Most modern infrared grills reach full temperature in three to five minutes, while standard charcoal grills require 15-20 minutes and gas grills need 10-15 minutes for proper preheating.
